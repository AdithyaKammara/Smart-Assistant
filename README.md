# 🤖 Generative AI ChatBot with OpenAI & LangChain

🎯 Developed during the **Generative AI Workshop** at **NxtWave CCBP 4.0 Academy (Aug 2023)**, this AI-powered chatbot merges conversational intelligence with a clean, interactive UI. It leverages **OpenAI** and **LangChain** for natural language understanding, uses **PlayHT** for voice cloning, and is wrapped in a **Gradio** web interface for ease of access.
